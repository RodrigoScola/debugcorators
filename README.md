# debugcorators README

Tired of encountering errors that you dont know about?

## Features

-    If a function has @throws, it will warn you if you dont use try catch

## What we are

We are a tool to warn developers (mainly js,ts) about pitfalls that the language does not warn about. Like functions that throw

## TODO

-    Should we only warn the user if the errors are on current file?
